# introduction

ASN.1 to C compiler takes the ASN.1 module files (example) and generates the C++ compatible C source code. That code can be 
used to serialize the native C structures into compact and unambiguous BER/OER/PER/XER-based data files, and deserialize the 
files back.

Various ASN.1 based formats are widely used in the industry, such as to encode the X.509 certificates employed in the HTTPS 
handshake, to exchange control data between mobile phones and cellular networks, to perform car-to-car communication in 
intelligent transportation networks.

The ASN.1 family of standards is large and complex, and no open source compiler supports it in its entirety. The asn1c is 
arguably the most evolved open source ASN.1 compiler.
